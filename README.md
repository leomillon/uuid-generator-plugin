# instanceid-generator-plugin
An IntelliJ Idea plugin to generate a 4 letter random String (for Liferay instance-id)

Liferay instances of web contents require a 4 letter identifier. This doesn't guarantee that no collision can occur, but this plugin will help provide a quick way to generate a 4 letter long string to generate such ids.
